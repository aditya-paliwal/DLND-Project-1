# Project Title
Daily bike rental ridership prediction using Simple Neural Network.


## Introduction

In this project, I built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset. By building a neural network from the ground up, I had got a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. I also learned how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems.

The data comes from [UCI Machine Learning Database.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)
